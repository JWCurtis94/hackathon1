As a team lead I ensure everyone knows what they are doing and that everyone is assigned to work within their comfort zone and what individuals are strong at doing.

I can code a strong framework within the HTML to ensure it works seamlessly with the CSS and help across the board with any trouble my team maybe having. I also have no problem reaching out for help to learn or make our project better.

So that together we make sure we are working efficiently and effectively across the project.
