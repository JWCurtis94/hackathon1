## DESIGN
  - **Typography**
    [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to provide the Poppins font chosen
  - **Colour scheme**
    The colour scheme chosen was predominantly black, white and shades of light grey to give a minimal and stylish look to the site without detracting from the colourful images of the city.
  - **Imagery**
    The images chosen were felt to represent the fun and dynamic nature of Las Vegas and also it's contrasting feel from day to night.
    The hero image was chosen to make a statement and make the user want to find out more about the city.
    [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) was used to provide the royalty-free stock images used. Acknowledgements for the individual photographers are in the [credits](#credits) section
